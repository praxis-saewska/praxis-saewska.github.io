# Cloudflare Pages Redirects
# 
# NOTE: Language-based redirects are handled by _worker.js
# Cloudflare Pages does not support Accept-Language conditions in _redirects file.
# 
# The Worker intercepts root path requests and redirects based on browser language:
# - Ukrainian (uk) -> /uk/
# - Russian (ru) -> /ru/
# - English (en) -> /en/
# - German (de) or default -> /de/
#
# This file can be used for other simple redirects if needed in the future.

# Simple redirect to default language (German)
# / /de/ 302
# /index.html /de/ 302
