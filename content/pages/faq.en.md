3. We discuss your concerns and questions
4. If necessary, we perform a gynecological examination
5. We discuss the further procedure together

Plan a bit more time for the first visit (approx. 30-45 minutes).

## Can I come without an appointment?

We strongly recommend making an appointment in advance to avoid waiting times and to give you sufficient time.

In urgent cases, we naturally try to treat you promptly. Please call in such cases beforehand.

## What does a treatment cost?

The costs depend on the type of treatment:

- **Statutorily Insured:** The legally required services are covered by your health insurance. Additional services (IGeL) must be paid for yourself.
- **Privately Insured:** The costs are calculated according to the fee schedule for doctors (GOÄ) and billed directly with your insurance.

We will be happy to inform you about the costs before a treatment.

## How can I renew prescriptions?

For the renewal of prescriptions, we usually need an appointment, as we must first check whether the medication is still appropriate.

In exceptional cases, we can also issue a prescription without an appointment after consultation. Please call us.

## Emergency Contact - What to do in emergencies?

**For medical emergencies, please contact:**

- Emergency: **112** (ambulance)

- Nearest hospital with gynecological emergency room

For non-acute questions, you can contact us during our office hours.

## How can I receive my examination results?

We usually discuss your examination results directly during an appointment with you.

On request, we can also send you the results in writing. Please note that for data protection reasons, we can only send to the address registered with us.

## Do you also offer home visits?

We generally do not offer home visits, as most examinations and treatments require the equipment of our practice.

In special exceptional cases, we can consider a home visit after consultation. Please contact us for more information.
