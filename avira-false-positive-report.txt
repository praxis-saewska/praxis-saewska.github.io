AVIRA FALSE POSITIVE REPORT
===========================

URL REPORTED: https://praxis-saewska.de/en/
DETECTION NAME: BehavesLike.HTML.Infected.lr
REPORT DATE: February 16, 2026

EXPLANATION:
------------

This is a FALSE POSITIVE detection. The reported URL is a legitimate medical practice website 
for "Praxis Dr. Elena Saewska" - a gynecological practice located in Berlin, Germany.

WEBSITE PURPOSE:
The website provides information about medical services, doctor credentials, appointment booking, 
and patient resources. It serves a legitimate healthcare business registered in Berlin.

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
------------------

1. HOSTING INFRASTRUCTURE:
   - Hosted on Cloudflare Pages (https://pages.cloudflare.com/)
   - Cloudflare Pages is a JAMstack platform for deploying static sites
   - Used by thousands of businesses including Fortune 500 companies
   - Provides automatic HTTPS, DDoS protection, and global CDN
   - Static files served directly from edge locations worldwide
   - Official Cloudflare service with enterprise-grade security

2. STATIC SITE GENERATOR:
   - Built using Pelican (Python-based static site generator)
   - Generates clean, static HTML pages
   - No dynamic code execution on the server
   - Source code: https://github.com/praxis-saewska/praxis-saewska.github.io

3. ROUTING MECHANISM (CLOUDFLARE PAGES STANDARD):
   - Uses _worker.js file in the root directory
   - This is Cloudflare Pages' STANDARD routing mechanism
   - Documentation: https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/functions/
   - The _worker.js file is automatically executed by Cloudflare's edge network
   - This is the OFFICIAL method for adding dynamic behavior to Cloudflare Pages
   - Equivalent to _redirects, _headers files used by other platforms (Netlify, Vercel)
   - Deployed and sandboxed entirely within Cloudflare's infrastructure

4. MULTILINGUAL SUPPORT (i18n):
   - Supports 4 languages: German (DE), English (EN), Russian (RU), Ukrainian (UK)
   - Uses Cloudflare Workers for automatic language detection and redirect
   - The redirect logic reads browser's Accept-Language header
   - Redirects to appropriate language subdirectory (/de/, /en/, /ru/, /uk/)
   - This is a STANDARD internationalization pattern used by major websites like Wikipedia
   - Similar implementations: MDN Web Docs, GNU Project, European Commission websites

5. CLOUDFLARE WORKER CODE ANALYSIS (_worker.js):
   - Likely trigger for the false positive
   - Contains legitimate redirect code for language preference detection
   - Uses standard Web APIs: Request.headers.get(), Response.redirect(), URL()
   - No malicious code, no obfuscation, no data exfiltration
   - Well-documented with extensive comments explaining functionality
   - Executes in Cloudflare's sandboxed V8 isolate environment
   - Cannot access local file system or perform server-side operations
   - Limited to HTTP request/response manipulation only
   - References: https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/

6. JAVASCRIPT LIBRARIES:
   - Vanilla Cookie Consent v2.9.1 (legitimate GDPR compliance library)
   - Source: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vanilla-cookieconsent@2.9.1/
   - No custom malicious scripts

7. SECURITY MEASURES IMPLEMENTED:
   - Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
   - X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
   - X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
   - Proper robots.txt and sitemap.xml
   - Valid SSL certificate
   - Professional schema.org structured data for medical business

WHY THIS IS A FALSE POSITIVE:
------------------------------

The detection likely triggered due to:
1. URL manipulation in _worker.js (new URL(), url.pathname checks)
2. Browser header inspection (Accept-Language)
3. Multiple redirect calls (Response.redirect())
4. Dynamic path construction

These are LEGITIMATE and STANDARD web development patterns that are:
- Officially documented by Cloudflare Pages
- Part of the Cloudflare Pages platform architecture
- Used by thousands of international websites
- Equivalent to standard routing configurations on other platforms
- Sandboxed and security-reviewed by Cloudflare's infrastructure
- Cannot perform malicious operations due to Worker execution environment

The _worker.js file is NOT arbitrary JavaScript code - it is part of Cloudflare's
official Pages Functions feature, similar to how Netlify uses _redirects or Vercel
uses vercel.json for routing configuration.

VERIFICATION:
-------------

You can verify this is a legitimate medical website by:

1. Visiting the website manually - it's a professional medical practice site
2. Checking business registration: 
   - Practice name: Praxis Dr. Elena Saewska
   - Address: Uhlandstr. 87, 10717 Berlin, Germany
   - BSNR (German medical practice number): 721090000
   - Email: info@praxis-saewska.de

3. Reviewing structured data on the site (Medical Business schema)
4. Checking domain reputation and SSL certificate validity
5. Scanning with multiple antivirus engines (VirusTotal) - only Avira flags it

IMPACT:
-------

This false positive is blocking legitimate patients from accessing important medical information 
and appointment booking services. Patients with Avira antivirus cannot access the website, 
which disrupts healthcare service delivery.

REQUEST:
--------

Please review and whitelist the following:
- Domain: praxis-saewska.de
- All subpaths: /de/, /en/, /ru/, /uk/
- Worker script: _worker.js

The website poses NO security threat and should be removed from your detection database.
